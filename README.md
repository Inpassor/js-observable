# Observable


## Install

You can clone the repository or use NPM package `js-observable`.


## Development

It is convenient to make changes to the `observable.js` code by running the command
`npm run watch`.


## Contribute

If you want to contribute, install dependencies and run `npm run build` command from
the root repo folder - this results in creating unminified (`observable.js`) and
minified (`observable.min.js`) bundles in `dist` directory.
